This is a Supercomputing Wales wrapper for the slurm simulator tools.

# Workflow


1. Create the necessary files with the command
 ./script.py config
 This command will perform the following steps:
 0. Start point - see config file:
  a. A csv file with grant attributions and account names
  b. A csv file, output from sacct, with historical job data.
  c. A file containing a '|'-separated value description of all
     the 'inital' qualities of service.
  c. A date (included in the range of dates that the historical 
     job data file span) where the simulation starts, and "history" 
     ends
  d. A saccmgr dump to modify - QOSes must be enabled for each 
     account.
  e. Names for the output files  
  d. the 'c_n' coefficients in the priority formula
 
 1. New QOS are computed for each account which got some attributions.
    2.1 New QOS are created - one per account
    2.2 Priority levels are computed 
    2.3 QOS_data.csv is modified accordingly
 
 2. QOS entries in the sacct_output are changed
 
 3. slurm.conf needs to be changed, allowing prioritised accounts 
    to access the QOSes just created

2.Create a tar archive with 
 tar -cvf scw.tar QOS_data.csv sacct_output.csv sunbird.csv slurm.conf
 Notice that the names  QOS_data.csv sacct_output.csv sunbird.csv
 need to match the names of the output files in the 'config' file
 that was passed to 'script.py'

3.Start the simulator container
4.Copy the scw.tar file into the simulator in the right position
5.Start the simulator in the container 

 # ISSUES
 - Data about grants and accounts is messy for Swansea (Aberystwyth is much 
   better)
